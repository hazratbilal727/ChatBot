✅ Feedback:
Your UI looks very clean and professional.

The gradient header is modern and visually appealing.

The chat bubbles and quick action buttons make it interactive.

You could enhance it further by adding animations (e.g., typing indicator, smooth message transitions).

Consider making the UI responsive for desktop view as well.
